Our hack is about the Waste Managment (Trashsters) from homes and industry. Here we employ workers to collect waste 
(biodegradable) from homes and other industrial places and process this to make manures,bioproducts etc which eventually is 
provided to the farmers and others at a subsidised rate. We have created a working prototype of website 
using IDE Eclipse. We have used Tomcat9.0 as our local host port 8090. 
We have created a basic version of website (frontend) using HTML5,JAVASCRIPT,BOOTSTRAP and CSS. Use Index.html file to have a look on website prototype.
