<b> <p>	
Have you ever thought twice before throwing that empty plastic packet smack in the middle of the road?Ever thrown up from the window 
of the car and wondered who have to clean it? Do you think it is a part of nature's great mysteries that the million tonnes of waste being unleashed onto God's green 
Earth every day disappear the next day? 
There are scores of men and women, who wake up in the wee hours of the morning, put on their masks and set forth to clean their city. No one thanks them, and most people don't even give a second thought to them. But there they are - the silent saviours - doing their bit to help save the environment 
that we have been taking for granted for a long time now.
</p><p>
We at TrashSters are fighting for this great change.
Join us and be help to make this world a better place!
