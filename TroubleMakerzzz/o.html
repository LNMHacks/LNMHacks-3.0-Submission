In Anthony Burgess&rsquo;s nightmare vision of the future, where criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends&rsquo; social pathology. A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex&mdash;to &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; him&mdash;the novel asks, &ldquo;At what cost?&rdquo;');

Explaining how relationships function, how parents shape their child&rsquo;s developing self, how psychotherapy really works, and how our society dangerously flouts essential emotional laws, this is a work of rare passion and eloquence that will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.');

Weaving together historical fact and personal reflections, the influential art critic Jed Perl reconstructs the amazing story of this pioneering bohemian artist who, although he died in 1721, when he was only thirty-six, has influenced innumerable painters and writers in the centuries since&mdash;and whose work continues to deepen our understanding of the place that love, friendship, and pleasure have in our daily lives.');

Here, in one of the most important and fascinating books of his career, Aldous Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy. He scrutinizes threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them. Brave New World Revisited is a trenchant plea that humankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late.');

But he was also the last of the Centaurans&mdash;or at least, half of him was&mdash;which meant that he was the only person who could operate the Centauri Device, a sentient bomb which might hold the key to settling a vicious space war.

Determined to find love on her own terms, she is intoxicated by her newfound freedom and the patriotic fervor of the day. That is, until a soldier reports her as his last sexual contact, sweeping her up in the government&rsquo;s wartime crusade against venereal disease. Quarantined in a detention center, Frieda finds in the Home&rsquo;s confines a group of brash, unforgettable women who help her see the way to a new kind of independence.');

Mordue chronicles his year-long global journey with his girlfriend, Lisa Nicol, exploring countries most Americans never see as well as issues of world citizenship in the 21st century.

A tragic turn of events, yes, but cockroaches are awesome coping machines, so Kockroach copes. Step by step, he learns the ways of man: how to walk, how to talk, and how to wear a jaunty brown fedora. Led by his primitive desires and insectile amorality, he navigates through the bizarre human realms of crime, business, politics, and sex. Will he find success or be squashed flat from above? Will he change humanity, or will humanity change him?');

What followed was the most significant literary obscenity trial of the twentieth century, as Penguin called upon a string of expert witnesses including E. M.

Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them. In a story spanning five decades, Last Night in Twisted River depicts the recent half-century in the United States as &ldquo;a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.&rdquo;');

Switching between human history and natural history, Leviathan is a gripping voyage of discovery into the heart of this obsession and the book that inspired it: Herman Melville&rsquo;s Moby-Dick. Taking us deep into the whale&rsquo;s domain, Philip Hoare shows us these mysterious animals as they have never been before.');
