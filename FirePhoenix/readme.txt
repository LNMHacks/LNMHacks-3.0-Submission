Project Name : Slides switching using OpenCV

software requirements : 1. OpenCV 2.4.13
                        2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

How to Run : You need to copy your presentaion file into c: directory and then rename your ppt as Name.pptx  and some changes into source code.
Example: your file name is lnmhacks.pptx change the line 20 " ShellExecute(NULL, L"open", L"C:\\name.pptx", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);  to " ShellExecute(NULL, L"open", L"C:\\lnmhacks.pptx", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);".
We make it simple to run by using Visual studio to convert all the program into a .exe file.
Then go to the project folder then go to the OpenCVPowerPoint folder.After opening the folder go to the debug folder and run detect.exe and the project will execute. 
            

How to Use: After the project will start executing you need to use blue colored object like a blue coloured paper covered on finger and move it towards the labelled tag "Open Your Slides".After that the ppt will be opened and then if you will move your finger or object near the webcam, then the Full Screen will be appeared.After that accordingly to your needs you can move the slides forward or backward and it will execute as per your instructions.
