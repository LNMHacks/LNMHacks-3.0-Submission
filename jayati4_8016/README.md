# COUPON SECURE

It is an application based on Blockchain Technology which is preventing the tempering of any information as well as unauthorised access of data to or from a malicious user or network.The idea of this project is to develop such a platform that can secure the coupon distribution system. Different blocks in the blockchain ensure that no information is altered.



## NECESSITY



Coupon system is very common in most of the sectors these days. The organisation of any event or a programme surely results in a coupon generated facilities for the attendees.However, this system is not at all secure as it results in wastage or misuse of coupons in large numbers. Considering a real example, LNMhacks provided the participants with coupons for meals per person which are prior to be misused easily

*1.  The paper based coupon system is not that much efficient as paper is very easy to be tempered or lost.*
*2. There is no detail about whether the coupon has been used or not.*
*3. It involves wastage of money in case a coupon is not used by a person. i.e. no record can be maintained for the usage of coupons.*

So,in order to eradicate the consequences of paper based coupon system, we have created a blockchain based application which generates coupons as well as ensures that no coupon is misused, tempered or wasted.




## WORKING



The administrator allots a certain number of coupons based on his requirements. Each block in the blockchain contains these transactions as they are generated. This is completely decentralised as the same information will be sent to all the servers connected. After the blocks are mined,the transaction is added to the blockchain. Now, this blockchain is accessible to all the sites where coupons are used for verification, collection etc.This ensures that alteration is not possible at any use case. Also, this is allocates coupons at real time which makes the process more transparent.
Moreover, we have added a feature of restricted time period and location in which the coupon can be claimed.The location of the user will directly tell him which coupons can be used over that area.This makes the system even more secure and precise, thus resulting in the least possible chances of unauthorised access. This is done by hypertrack API which provides realtime location services.
Another advantage of this system is that because of realtime tracking, the number of unused transactions can be recorded and thus no leftover coupons will be wasted. This also reduces the chances of duplicacy.
